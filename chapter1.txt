 code -r chapter1.txt = open and create file
 from working directory eg story then I need to add this file to what's called a staging area, and that is basically a intermediate
place where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory that you want to commit.
use the git status command
git add chpater1.txt = to add the file into the staging area
then git status again to see if the file has been added into the staging area
 use present tence here 
 git log - to see what commits youve made
 git add . to just add all files so you dont have to add them 1by1
