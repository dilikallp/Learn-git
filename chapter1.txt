 code -r chapter1.txt = open and create file
 from working directory eg story then I need to add this file to what's called a staging area, and that is basically a intermediate
place where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory that you want to commit.
use the git status command
git add chpater1.txt = to add the file into the staging area
then git status again to see if the file has been added into the staging area
 use present tence here 
 git commit = to move these files from the staging are to be commited (local reposetry)
 git push =(add to remote reposetry github) its a bit more complex than thisgit 
 git log - to see what commits youve made
 git add . to just add all files so you dont have to add them 1by1(to staging area)
 when you see HEAD -> Master that is the curret state that we are in
git touch .gitignore (small letters this is a hidden file, check on hyper terminal if here it doesnt show)
code .gitignore 
to open it =open -a /Story/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app .git
 Recap
 inside the Story directory that is were we initialise git = git initialise
 then git will track the changes made between the working directory and the local reposetry 
 we use git add to push the files created in the work directory to the staging area
 git add = to the staging is Well, sometimes you might not want to add all of your files to be tracked or all of your files to be
committed. So the staging area is a good place to try and figure out what are the things that you want git to ignore
and what are the things that you want to be tracked at once.
we can use git checkout to go back -this skips from the local reposetry back to the working directory 
git log quit = q
first use git status to see the modified version 
youll see this version has not been added to the staging are or commited to the local reposetry
to checkout the diffrence between the commited version and the current version use git diff chapter2.txt = git diff "name of the file"
git checkout "filename" = will remove all nw changes and revert back to the last version commitedg
